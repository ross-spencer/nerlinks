Lyrics. . , ENJOLRAS, Here upon these stones, We will build our barricade, In the heart of the city, We claim as our own!, Each man to his duty, And don't be afraid., Wait! I will need a report, On the strength of the foe., JAVERT [disguised as a rebel], I can find out the truth, I know their ways, Fought their wars, Served my time, In the days, Of my youth!, VARIOUS STUDENTS, Now the people will fight, And so they might, Dogs will back, Fleas will bite., They will do what is right, [Marius spots Eponine, who is dressed as a boy.], MARIUS, Hey little boy, what's this I see?, God Eponine, the things you do!, EPONINE, I know this is no place for me, Still I would rather be with you., MARIUS, Get out before the trouble starts, Get out, 'Ponine, you might get shot, EPONINE, I got you worried, now I have, That shows you like me quite a lot, MARIUS, There is a way that you can help, You are the answer to a prayer, Please take this letter to Cosette, And pray to God that she's still there!.  [She walks to the Rue Plumet...], EPONINE, Little you know..., Little you care!, [...where she meets Valjean.], I have a letter M'sieur, It's addressed to your daughter Cosette, It's from a boy at the barricade, Sir, In the Rue de Villette., VALJEAN, Give me that letter here, my boy, EPONINE, He said to give it to Cosette, VALJEAN, You have my word that my daughter will know, What this letter contains., [He gives her a coin.], Tell the young man she will read it tomorrow, And here's for your pains, Go careful now, stay out of sight, There's danger in the streets tonight., [He opens the letter... and reads it.], ``Dearest Cosette, you have entered my soul, And soon you will be gone., Can it be only a day since we met, And the world was reborn?, If I should fall in the battle to come, Let this be my goodbye, Now that I know you love me as well, It is harder to die..., I pray that god will bring me home, To be with you., Pray for your Marius, he prays for you!'', [Valjean goes in, leaving Eponine alone.] Les Miserables Lyrics
