Upon this day of days!, May all the angels.  Of the Lord above, In jubilation.  Sing their songs of praise!, And crown this.  Blessed time with.  Peace and love., (The procession becomes a dancing celebration. A waltz is played), MAJOR DOMO, The Baron and Baroness de Thйnard wish to pay their respects to the groom!, .  THENARDIER, I forget where we met, Was it not at the Chateau Lafarge, Where the Duke did that puke, Down the Duchess's de-coll-etage?, MARIUS, No, `Baron de Thйnard', The circles I move in are humbler by far., Go away, Thйnardier!, Do you think I don't know who you are?, MME. THENARDIER, He's not fooled. Told you so., Show M'sieur what you've come here to show., Tell the boy what you know!, (Applause from the dancers as the waltz finishes), MARIUS, When I look at you, I remember Eponine., She was more than you deserved, who gave her birth, But now she is with God and happier, I hope,, Than here on earth!, The waltz starts up again., THENARDIER, So it goes, heaven knows, Life has dealt me some terrible blows., MME. THENARDIER, You've got cash and a heart, You could give us a bit of a start!, We can prove, plain as ink, Your bride's father is not what you think., THENARDIER, There's a tale I could tell, MME. THENARDIER, Information we're willing to sell..., THENARDIER, There's a man that he slew, I saw the corpse clear as I'm seeing you!, What I tell you is true!, MME. THENARDIER, Pity to disturb you at a feast like this, But five hundred francs surely wouldn't come amiss., MARIUS, In God's name say what you have to say., THENARDIER, But first you pay!, What I saw, clear as light,, Jean Valjean in the sewers that night., Had this corpse on his back, Hanging there like a bloody great sack., I was there, never fear., Even found me this fine souvenir.. . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . , (Thйnardier shows Marius a ring), MARIUS, I know this! This was mine!, This is surely some heavenly sign!. . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . , THENARDIER, One thing more, mark this well, It was the night the barricades fell., MARIUS, Then it's true. Then I'm right., Jean Valjean was my savior that night!.  (Marius punches Thйnardier and then throws money at him).  .  As for you, take this too!, God forgive the things that we do., Come my love, come Cosette,, This day's blessings are not over yet!, (Marius and Cosette leave) Les Miserables Lyrics
