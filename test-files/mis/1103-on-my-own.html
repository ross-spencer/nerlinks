
 The Original Broadway Production,  Les Miserables the Musical - On My Own . .  .  Lyrics. . . , And now I'm all alone again, Nowhere to go, no one to turn to., Did not want your money sir, Came out here cuz I was told to..  And now the night is near, Now I can make believe he's here., Sometimes I walk alone at night, When everybody else is sleeping., I think of him, and then I'm happy, With the company I'm keeping., The city goes to bed,, And I can live inside my head., On my own,, Pretending he's beside me., All alone,, I walk with him till morning., Without him,, I feel his arms around me,, And when I lose my way I close my eyes, And he has found me., In the rain,, The pavement shines like silver., All the lights, Are misty in the river., In the darkness,, The trees are full of starlight,, And all I see is him and me for ever and forever., And I know, It's only in my mind,, That I'm talking to myself, And not to him., And although I know that he is blind,, Still I say,, There's a way for us., I love him,, But when the night is over,, He is gone,, The river's just a river., Without him,, The world around me changes., The trees are bare and everywhere.  The streets are full of strangers., I love him,, But every day I'm learning,, All my life, I've only been pretending!, Without me,, His world will go on turning,, The world is full of happiness that I have never known!, I love him..., I love him..., I love him..., But only on my own... Les Miserables Lyrics
