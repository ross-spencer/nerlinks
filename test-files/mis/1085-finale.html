
 The Original Broadway Production,  Les Miserables the Musical - Finale Lyrics.  CHORUS, Do you hear the people sing, Lost in the valley of the night?, It is the music of a people, Who are climbing to the light., For the wretched of the earth, There is a flame that never dies., Even the darkest night will end, And the sun will rise., They will live again in freedom, In the garden of the Lord., They will walk behind the plough-share,, They will put away the sword., The chain will be broken, And all men will have their reward., Will you join in our crusade?, Who will be strong and stand with me?, Somewhere beyond the barricade, Is there a world you long to see?, Do you hear the people sing?, Say, do you hear the distant drums?, It is the future that they bring, When tomorrow comes!, Will you join in our crusade?, Who will be strong and stand with me?, Somewhere beyond the barricade, Is there a world you long to see?, Do you hear the people sing?, Say, do you hear the distant drums?, It is the future that they bring, When tomorrow comes..., Tomorrow comes! Les Miserables Lyrics
