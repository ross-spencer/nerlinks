
 The Original Broadway Production,  Les Miserables the Musical - Javert at the Barricade / Little People Lyrics. , GAVROCHE, They laugh at me, these fellas,, Just because I am small, They laugh at me because I'm not hundred feet tall!, I tell 'em there's aot to learn down here on the ground, The world is big, but little people turn it around!, A worm can roll a stone, A bee can sting a bear, A fly can fly around Versailles, 'Cos flies don't care!, A sparrow in a hut, Can make a happy home, A flea can bite the bottom, Of the Pope in Rome!, Gaoliath was a buiser who was tall as the sky., But David threw a right and gave him one in the eye., I never read the Bible but I know that it's true, It only goes to show what little people can do!, ALL, A worm can roll a stone, A bee can sting a bear, A fly can fly around Versailles, 'Cos flies don't care!, A sparrow in a hut, Can make a happy home, A flea can bite the bottom, Of the Pope in Rome!, GAVROCHE, So listen here professor,, With your head in the cloud., It's often kind of useful, To get lost in the crowd., So keep your universities, I don't give a damn, For better or for worse it is, The way that I am!, Be careful where you go, 'Cos little people grow..., And little people know, When little people fight, We may look easy pickings but we got some bite!, So never kick a dog because he's just a pup, You better run for cover when the pup grows up!, And we'll fight like twenty armies, And we won't give up, ALL, A worm can roll a stone, A bee can sting a bear, A fly can fly around Versailles, 'Cos flies don't care!, A sparrow in a hut, Can make a happy home, A flea can bite the bottom, Of the Pope in Rome!
