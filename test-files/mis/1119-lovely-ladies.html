WOMEN, Lovely ladies, Waiting for a bite, Waiting for the customers, Who only come at night, Lovely ladies, Ready for the call, Standing up or lying down, Or any way at all, Bargain prices up against the wall, OLD WOMAN, Come here, my dear, Let's see this trinket you wear, This bagatelle..., FANTINE, Madame, I'll sell it to you..., OLD WOMAN, I'll give you four, FANTINE, That wouldn't pay for the chain!, OLD WOMAN, I'll give you five. You're far to eager to sell..  It's up to you., FANTINE, It's all I have, OLD WOMAN, That's not my fault, OLD WOMAN, No more than five, My dear, we all must stay alive!.  WOMEN, Lovely ladies, Waiting in the dark, Ready for a thick one, Or a quick one in the park, Whore 1, Long time short time, Any time, my dear, Cost a little extra if you want to take all year!, ALL, Quick and cheap is underneath the pier!, CRONE, What pretty hair!, What pretty locks you got there, What luck you got. It's worth a centime, my dear, I'll take the lot, FANTINE, Don't touch me! Leave me alone!, CRONE, Let's make a price., I'll give you all of ten francs,, Just think of that!, FANTINE, It pays a debt, CRONE, Just think of that, FANTINE, What can I do? It pays a debt., Ten francs may save my poor Cosette!.  SAILOR THREE, Lovely lady!, Fastest on the street, Wasn't there three minutes, She was back up on her feet, SAILOR ONE, Lovely lady!, What yer waiting for?, Doesn't take a lot of savvy, Just to be a whore, Come on, lady, What's a lady for?, [Fantine re-emerges, her long hair cut short], PIMP, Give me the dirt, who's that bit over there?, WHORE ONE, A bit of skirt. She's the one sold her hair., WHORE TWO, She's got a kid. Sends her all that she can, PIMP, I might have known, There is always some man, Lovely lady, come along and join us!, Lovely lady!, WHORE ONE, Come on dearie, why all the fuss?, You're no grander than the rest of us, Life has dropped you at the bottom of the heap, Join your sisters, WHORE TWO, Make money in your sleep!, [Fantine goes off with one of the sailors], WHORE ONE, That's right dearie, let him have the lot, WHORE THREE, That's right dearie, show him what you've got!.  WOMEN, Old men, young men, take 'em as they come, Harbor rats and alley cats and every kind of scum, Poor men, rich men, leaders of the land, See them with their trousers off they're never quite as grand, All it takes is money in your hand!, Lovely ladies, Going for a song, Got a lot of callers, But they never stay for long, FANTINE, Come on, Captain,, you can wear your shoes, Don't it make a change, To have a girl who can't refuse, Easy money, Lying on a bed, Just as well they never see, The hate that's in your head, Don't they know they're making love, To one already dead! Les Miserables Lyrics.
