WOMAN FIVE, Who will wake them?, WOMAN SIX, No one ever will., WOMAN TWO, No one ever told them, That a summer day can kill., WOMAN SEVEN, They were schoolboys, Never held a gun..., Fighting for a new world, That would rise up like the sun., WOMAN THREE, Where's that new world now the fighting's done?, .  WOMAN FOUR.  Nothing changes., WOMAN SEVEN, Nothing ever will., WOMAN EIGHT, Every year another brat, another mouth to fill., WOMAN SEVEN, Same old story. What's the use of tears?, WOMAN FIVE, What's the use of praying if there's nobody who hears?, ALL.  Turning, turning, turning, turning, turning, Through the years..  Turning, turning, turning through the years, Minutes into hours and the hours into years., Nothing changes. Nothing ever can, Round about the roundabout and back where you began., Round and round and back where you began! Les Miserables Lyrics
