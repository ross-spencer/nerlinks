
 The Original Broadway Production,   Les Miserables the Musical - Castle on a Cloud Lyrics. , YOUNG COSETTE, There is a castle on a cloud,, I like to go there in my sleep,, Aren't any floors for me to sweep,, Not in my castle on a cloud., There is a room that's full of toys,, There are a hundred boys and girls,, Nobody shouts or talks too loud,, Not in my castle on a cloud., There is a lady all in white,, Holds me and sings a lullaby,, She's nice to see and she's soft to touch,, She says "Cosette, I love you very much.", I know a place where no one's lost,, I know a place where no one cries,, Crying at all is not allowed,, Not in my castle on a cloud., Oh help! I think I hear them now,, and I'm nowhere near finished sweeping and, scrubbing and polishing the floor., Oh, it's her! It's Madame!, MME. THENARDIER, Now look who's here, The little madam herself!, Pretending once again she's been `so awfully good,', Better not let me catch you slacking, Better not catch my eye!, Ten rotten francs your mother sends me, What is that going to buy?, Now take that pail, My little `Mademoiselle', And go and draw some water from the well!, We should never have taken you in in the first place, How stupid the things that we do!, Like mother like daughter, the scum of the street., Eponine, come my dear, Eponine, let me see you, You look very well in that new little blue hat, There's some little girls who know how to behave, And they know what to wear, And I'm saying thank heaven for that., Still there Cosette?, Your tears will do you no good!, I told you fetch some water from the well in the wood!, YOUNG COSETTE, Please do not send me out alone, Not in the darkness on my own!, MME. THENARDIER, Enough of that, or I'll forget to be nice!, You heard me ask for something,, And I never ask twice! Les Miserables Lyrics
