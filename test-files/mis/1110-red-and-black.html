FEUILLY, At rue de Bac they're straining at the leash!, COURFEYRAC, Students, workers, everyone, There's a river on the run, Like the flowing of the tide, Paris coming to our side!, ENJORAS, The time is near, So near it's stirring the blood in their veins!, And yet beware, Don't let the wine go to your brains!, For the army we fight is a dangerous foe, With the men and the arms that we never can match, It is easy to sit here and swat 'em like flies, But the national guard will be harder to catch., We need a sign, To rally the people, To call them to arms, To bring them in line!, (Marius enters), Marius, you're late., JOLY, What's wrong today?, You look as if you've seen a ghost., GRANTAIRE, Some wine and say what's going on!, MARIUS, A ghost you say... a ghost maybe, She was just like a ghost to me, One minute there, and she was gone!, GRANTAIRE, I am agog!, I am aghast!, Is Marius in love at last?, I've never heard him `ooh' and `aah', You talk of battles to be won, And here he comes like Don Ju-an, It's better than an o-per-a!, ENJOLRAS, It is time for us all, To decide who we are, Do we fight for the right.  To a night at the opera now?, Have you asked of yourselves, What's the price you might pay?, Is it simply a game, For rich young boys to play?, The color of the world, Is changing day by day..., Red - the blood of angry men!, Black - the dark of ages past!, Red - a world about to dawn!, Black - the night that ends at last!, MARIUS, Had you been there tonight, You might know how it feels, To be struck to the bone, In a moment of breathless delight!, Had you been there tonight, You might also have known, How the world may be changed, In just one burst of light!, And what was right seems wrong, And what was wrong seems right!, GRANTAIRE, Red..., MARIUS, I feel my soul on fire!, GRANTAIRE, Black..., MARIUS, My world if she's not there!, ALL, Red..., MARIUS, The color of desire!, ALL, Black..., MARIUS, The color of despair!, ENJOLRAS, Marius, you're no longer a child, I do not doubt you mean it well, But now there is a higher call., Who cares about your lonely soul?, We strive toward a larger goal, Our little lives don't count at all!, ALL, Red - the blood of angry men!, Black - the dark of ages past!, Red - a world about to dawn!, Black - the night that ends at last!, ENJOLRAS, Well, Courfeyrac, do we have all the guns?, Feuilly, Combeferre, our time is running short., Grantaire, put the bottle down!, Do we have the guns we need?, GRANTAIRE, Give me brandy on my breath, And I'll breathe them all to death!, COURFEYRAC, In St. Antoine they're with us to a man!, COMBEFERRE, In Notre Dame they're tearing up the stones!, .  FEUILLY, Twenty rifles good as new!, (Gavroche rushes in shouting), GAVROCHE, Listen!, JOLY, Twenty rounds for every man!, GAVROCHE, Listen to me!, JEAN PROUVAIRE, Double that in Port St. Cloud!, GAVROCHE, Listen everybody!, LESGLES, Seven guns in St. Martin!, GAVROCHE, General Lamarque is dead!, ENJOLRAS, Lamarque is dead., Lamarque! His death is the hour of fate., The people's man., His death is the sign we await!, On his funeral day they will honor his name., It's a rallying cry that will reach every ear!, In the death of Lamarque we will kindle the flame, They will see that the day of salvation is near!, The time is near!, Let us welcome it gladly with courage and cheer, Let us take to the streets with no doubt in our hearts, But a jubilant shout, They will come one and all, They will come when we call!
