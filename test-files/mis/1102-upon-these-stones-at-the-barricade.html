Lyrics. . . , (The barricade is now complete.), STUDENTS, Now we pledge ourselves to hold this barricade, Let them come in their legions, And they will be met, Have faith in yourselves, And don't be afraid, Let's give 'em a screwing, That they'll never forget!, This is where it begins!, And if I should die in the fight to be free, Where the fighting is hardest, There will I be, Let them come if they dare, We'll be there!, ARMY OFFICER (Offstage), You at the barricade listen to this, No one is coming to help you to fight, You're on your own, You have no friends, Give up your guns - or die!, ENJOLRAS, Damn their warnings, damn their lies, They will see the people rise!, STUDENTS, Damn their warnings, damn their lies, They will see the people rise!.  (Javert climbs over the barricade.), JAVERT, Listen my friends, I have done as I said, I have been to their lines, I have counted each man, I will tell what I can, Better be warned, They have armies to spare, And the danger is real, We will need all our cunning, To bring them to heel., ENJOLRAS, Have faith, If you know what their movements are, We'll spoil their game, There are ways that a people can fight, We shall overcome their power, JAVERT, I have overheard their plans, There will be no attack tonight, They intend to starve us out, Before they start a proper fight, Concentrate their force, Hit us from the right.
