Beggars, urchins, prostitutes, students, etc., BEGGARS, Look down and see the beggars at your feet, Look down and show some mercy if you can, Look down and see the sweepings of the street, Look down, look down,, Upon your fellow man!, GAVROCHE, 'Ow do you do? My name's Gavroche., These are my people. Here's my patch., Not much to look at, nothing posh, Nothing that you'd call up to scratch., This is my school, my high society, Here in the slums of Saint Michele, We live on crumbs of humble piety, Tough on the teeth, but what the hell!, Think you're poor?, Think you're free?, Follow me! Follow me!, BEGGARS, Look down and show some mercy if you can, Look down, look down, upon your fellow man!, (An old beggar woman finds a young prostitute occupying her pitch), OLD BEGGAR WOMAN, What you think yer at?, Hanging round me pitch?, If you're new around here, girl, You've got a lot to learn!, YOUNG PROSTITUTE, Listen you old bat..., Crazy bloody witch..., 'Least I give me customers, Some pleasure in return!, OLD BEGGAR WOMAN, I know what you give!, Give 'em all the pox!, Spread around your poison, Till they end up in a box., PIMP, Leave the poor old cow,, Move it, Madeleine., She used to be no better, Till the clap got to her brain., BEGGARS, When's it gonna end?, When we gonna live?, Something's gotta happen now or, Something's gonna give, It'll come, it'll come, it'll come, It'll come, it'll come, it'll come, ENJOLRAS, Where the leaders of the land?, Where are the swells who run this show?, MARIUS, Only one man - and that's Lamarque, Speaks for these people here below., BEGGARS, See our children fed, Help us in our shame, Something for a crust of bread, In Holy Jesus' name, URCHIN, In the Lord's Holy name., BEGGARS, In his name, in his name, in his name..., MARIUS, Lamarque is ill and fading fast!, Won't last the week out, so they say., ENJOLRAS, With all the anger in the land, How long before the judgement day?, Before we cut the fat ones down to size?, Before the barricades arise?, GAVROCHE, Watch out for old Thenardier, All of his family's on the make, Once ran a hash-house down the way, Bit of a swine and no mistake, He's got a gang, The bleeding layabout, Even his daughter does her share, That's Eponine, she knows her way about, Only a kid, but hard to scare, Do we care?, Not a cuss, Long live us., Long live us!, BEGGARS, Look down and show some mercy if you can, Look down, look down upon your fellow man!
